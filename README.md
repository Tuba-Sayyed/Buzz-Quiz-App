For my university project, I developed my first Android application, marking my initial experience with Kotlin and Android Studio. This project provided a valuable learning opportunity, particularly in designing the applicationâ€™s logo and user interface. Despite encountering some challenges with Gradle and view binding, the overall experience was immensely rewarding and educational.
